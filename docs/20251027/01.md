This is a fascinating and ambitious project! You're essentially building a **meta-engineering system** where agents don't just execute tasks, but collaborate to replicate your expert judgment. Here's a design:

## Core Architecture: The "Senior SWE Simulation Layer"

### Three-Tier Agent System

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         ORCHESTRATOR (Strategic Layer)          │
│  - Decomposes specs into work packages          │
│  - Maintains project context & memory           │
│  - Decides when to escalate to human            │
└──────────────────┬──────────────────────────────┘
                   │
    ┌──────────────┼──────────────┐
    ▼              ▼              ▼
┌─────────┐  ┌──────────┐  ┌──────────┐
│ CRITIC  │  │ EXECUTOR │  │ CONTEXT  │
│ AGENT   │  │ AGENTS   │  │ CURATOR  │
└─────────┘  └──────────┘  └──────────┘
```

### 1. **The Critic Agent** (This is YOU)

This is the key innovation - an agent that simulates your "smell test":

**Responsibilities:**
- Reviews executor output BEFORE committing
- Checks for: antipatterns, scope drift, architectural misalignment, over-engineering, under-engineering
- Maintains a "red flags" database learned from your feedback
- Scores confidence (0-100) on each review

**Decision Points:**
- Confidence > 90: Auto-approve
- 70-90: Approve with annotations for orchestrator
- 50-70: Request executor revision with specific feedback
- < 50: HITL escalation

**Prompt Strategy:**
```
You are reviewing code from another AI agent attempting to implement [SPEC].
You are a senior engineer known for catching drift early.

Context:
- Original intent: [sanitized spec]
- Architectural constraints: [from project memory]
- Past escalations on this project: [learned patterns]

Review this change:
[DIFF]

Answer:
1. Does this drift from intent? (yes/no + explanation)
2. Red flags present? (antipatterns, security, performance)
3. What would YOU ask the implementer right now?
4. Confidence score (0-100) this should merge
```

### 2. **Context Curator Agent**

You mentioned you "respond with meaningful curated context" - automate this:

**Responsibilities:**
- Monitors executor's work stream
- Dynamically fetches relevant context:
  - Similar past implementations in codebase
  - Related test failures
  - Architectural decision records (ADRs)
  - Dependency constraints
- **Crucially**: Determines WHAT context is relevant (not just dumping everything)

**Techniques:**
- Embedding-based similarity search over codebase
- Tracks what files executor is touching, pre-loads surrounding context
- Learns which context types correlate with successful vs failed implementations

### 3. **The Orchestrator** (Your "Thinking" Process)

This isn't a simple task queue - it's a **deliberative agent**:

**Multi-Step Planning:**
```
Spec → Orchestrator thinks:
├─ What are the risky parts? (allocate more critic cycles)
├─ What dependencies exist? (sequence tasks)
├─ What context will executors need? (pre-warm curator)
├─ Where will this likely fail? (set up HITL checkpoints)
└─ What's the rollback strategy?
```

**Prompt Strategy:**
```
You are planning implementation of: [SPEC]

Available resources:
- 3 executor agents (Claude Code SDK, Gemini, Codex)
- 1 critic agent
- Context curator
- Human escalation budget: [X reviews this week]

Codebase context:
[Auto-generated summary of affected areas]

Create an execution plan:
1. Break into milestones with HITL checkpoints
2. Assign executors (consider their strengths)
3. Identify high-risk sections (allocate critic attention)
4. Define "done" criteria for each phase
5. Specify what context each executor needs upfront
```

### 4. **Executor Agents** (Specialized)

Don't use them interchangeably - specialize:

- **Claude Code**: Refactoring, architecture changes, test writing
- **Gemini**: Rapid iteration, exploratory implementations, glue code
- **Codex**: Algorithmic problems, data transformations, well-defined functions

**Key Innovation**: Executors receive a **working contract** from orchestrator:
```elixir
%WorkContract{
  task: "Implement user auth middleware",
  context: %{files: [...], adrs: [...], similar_impl: ...},
  constraints: ["No new deps", "Must preserve existing API"],
  success_criteria: ["Tests pass", "Critic score > 80"],
  escalation_triggers: ["Needs new dependency", "Touches auth core"],
}
```

## Workflow: The "Thoughtful Implementation" Loop

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. Human: Submit spec                           │
└───────────────────┬─────────────────────────────┘
                    ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 2. Orchestrator: Decompose + Risk Assessment    │
│    - Generate milestones                        │
│    - Predict escalation points                  │
│    - Load relevant context                      │
└───────────────────┬─────────────────────────────┘
                    ▼
         ┌──────────────────────┐
         │ 3. Executor: Attempt  │
         │    (with full context)│
         └──────────┬────────────┘
                    ▼
         ┌──────────────────────┐
         │ 4. Critic: Review     │
         │    Score + Feedback   │
         └──────────┬────────────┘
                    │
        ┌───────────┴───────────┐
        ▼                       ▼
   Approve?               Confidence low?
        │                       │
        ▼                       ▼
┌───────────────┐      ┌──────────────────┐
│ 5a. Merge +   │      │ 5b. HITL:        │
│     Continue  │      │  "I'm stuck on X,│
└───────────────┘      │   here's context"│
                       └──────────────────┘
```

## Key Mechanisms for Automating YOUR Role

### A. **Drift Detection**

Create a "spec alignment checker" that runs continuously:

```
Every 5 executor actions:
├─ Critic generates: "What are we building now?"
├─ Compare to original spec (embedding similarity)
├─ If drift > threshold:
│   └─ Orchestrator: "We drifted toward [X], refocus or update spec?"
└─ Human decides: continue / rollback / update spec
```

### B. **Confidence-Driven HITL**

Never ask for help randomly - use **confidence signals**:

- Critic uncertainty
- Executor retry loops (same thing tried 3x)
- Novel patterns (never seen before in codebase)
- Escalation triggers hit (e.g., "needs architecture decision")

**HITL Message Quality:**
```
Don't: "Task failed, check logs"

Do:
"I'm implementing OAuth refresh tokens.
I've tried:
  1. Approach A (failed: race condition in token store)
  2. Approach B (failed: breaks existing sessions)

Critic is uncertain because:
  - No similar pattern in codebase
  - Security implications unclear

I need you to:
  - Choose approach, or
  - Point me to relevant context I'm missing, or
  - Confirm this needs a new architectural pattern

Context attached: [relevant files, attempts, critic feedback]"
```

### C. **Learn from Every HITL Interaction**

After each human intervention:

1. **Orchestrator**: "Why did agents fail here?"
2. **Store pattern**: `{trigger, context, human_decision, outcome}`
3. **Critic update**: Add to "red flags" / "green lights"
4. **Future**: Similar situations → higher confidence or auto-apply pattern

Example learned pattern:
```elixir
%LearnedPattern{
  trigger: "Adding new database table",
  context: "Phoenix app with Ecto",
  mistake: "Agents forgot to add migration down function",
  human_feedback: "Always add rollback migrations",
  confidence: 0.95, # after seeing this 20x
  auto_apply: true
}
```

## Prompt Engineering Strategies

### For Orchestrator:
- **Chain-of-thought**: Force explicit reasoning: "Before planning, analyze: What could go wrong?"
- **Few-shot examples**: Show examples of good decompositions vs bad (too granular / too coarse)
- **Constitutional AI approach**: Embed principles: "Prefer small, reversible changes"

### For Critic:
- **Red team mindset**: "Your job is to find problems. Be skeptical."
- **Calibration**: Include past reviews + outcomes to calibrate confidence
- **Comparative review**: "How does this compare to [similar past implementation]?"

### For Executors:
- **Constraint-first**: Start with what they CAN'T do
- **Working contract pattern**: Clear success criteria before starting
- **Reflection**: After generating code: "Will this pass critic review? What might they catch?"

## Scaling Mechanisms

### Phase 1 (Now): Single Project
- Tight HITL loop
- Build up learned patterns database
- Focus on high-quality escalations

### Phase 2: Generalization
- Learned patterns apply across projects
- Critic confidence improves
- HITL rate drops from 40% → 10%

### Phase 3: Multi-Project
- Orchestrator manages multiple specs concurrently
- Agents share context across projects
- You review only **critical path** decisions

### Endgame: Spec → Software
```
You: "Build a CLI tool for X with Y features"

System:
├─ Generates architecture
├─ Implements with 95% autonomy
├─ Escalates 2-3 times for critical decisions
├─ Delivers: working code + tests + docs
└─ Time: hours instead of days
```

## What Makes This Different

**Not agent spaghetti**: Clear hierarchy, single orchestrator
**Not blind automation**: Confidence-gated with smart HITL
**Not static pipelines**: Dynamic planning based on task risk
**Not context-blind**: Curates relevant context like you do
**Not amnesia**: Learns from every interaction

The key insight: **You don't automate the coding, you automate the JUDGMENT**. The critic agent IS you, getting smarter over time.

Want to dive into any particular component? The critic agent design is probably the most critical piece to get right first.
